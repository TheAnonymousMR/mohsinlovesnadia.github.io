      <p>I still remember how nervous I was... <br> Going out to Midland to show my effort in us. <br> I didn't know it would lead to such a great love.

    <h2>To My Lobster, My Nadia</h2>
    <p>
      If you’ve found your way here, it means time has passed, the wind has settled, and maybe just maybe your heart is open to the sound of mine again.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn’t just a letter. It’s a reminder. Of how far we’ve come, how much we’ve grown, and how real this love has always beeen. We still held on. Even when we were asked to let go.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know we had to take a step back. Life asked us to breathe. To learn. To face our own reflections and rebuild our hearts from the inside out. It wasn’t easy not for either of us. But I want you to know: not a single day went by that I didn’t think of you. Not one morning where I didn’t hope you were smiling. Not one night where I didn’t send you love in the quiet, even if you couldn’t hear it.
    </p>

    <p>
      We went through adversity, Nadia. But love like ours doesn’t dissolve in distance. It deepens. It sharpens. It finds its way back, if it’s real. And ours has always been real.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love you. Not just when it's easy, but even when it's hard. I love your mind, your laugh, the way your heart overflows even when it’s scared. I love the way you challenge me, the way you see beauty in broken things. I love the future I see in your eyes. A future I still believe in, even now.
    </p>

    <p>
      So if you're reading this if your heart still beats a little louder at the thought of me I want you to come back.
    </p>

    <p>
      Come back to the safe place we were building. Come back to the memories we never finished making. Come back to the promise we whispered between tired nights and good mornings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let’s pick up the pieces, gently this time. Let’s learn how to love each other again, with more patience, more understanding, and even more tenderness than before. Because I still believe in us, Nadia.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Do you?</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
      Forever waiting with open arms,<br>
      <em>Your Lobster</em>
